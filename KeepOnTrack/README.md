##Office 365 Client Libraries for Web Projects##

This sample demonstrates how to use **Office365 APIs** in combination with an ASP.NET MVC Web Application.

Review the **CalendarAPISample** class, it has been generated by Office365 API Tools and the functionality to persist new Events within Office365 has been added.

In Order to get such a sample running, you've to call CalendarAPISample from within a Controller, ensure that your controller is configured to do async calls by changing the method signature to

    public Task<ActionResult> Index(){
       // ...
    }

For creating views based on Office365 Client Objects, you should create a strongly typed view. Either by using internal classes such as `Microsoft.Office365.Exchange.IEvent` or `IEnumerable<Microsoft.Office365.Exchange.IEvent>` for list views. 

Alternatively you can create your own Models and Convert Office 365 result objects to your DTO's and use them within your Web Application.
